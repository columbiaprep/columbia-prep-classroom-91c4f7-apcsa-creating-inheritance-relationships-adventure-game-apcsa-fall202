# CGPS Adventure Game

## Project 2: Representing our Character

### Task 1: Draw our Character
Add a toString() method to Adventurer that will display what the character will look like on an open, grid-like world. This is likely going to just be an emoji, so this is an easy task and is just practice for what comes after.

Then, add a toString() method to your Item to display the stat bonuses and qualities of your item.

Additionally, do all of your work in a branch named after your first name last initial and task. For instance, my branch will be **aubreys2-1**.

### Task 2: Writing a Character displayInventory() method
In the Character class, alter the constructor method to give a Player a default set of equipment. Use the constructors of *all* of your classmates in this work.

Then, in the Character class, write a method called displayCharacter() to display the current character's gear in an organized list, printing out the properties of each item.

Additionally, do all of your work in a branch named after your first name last initial and task. For instance, my branch will be **aubreys2-2**.
