# CGPS Adventure Game

## Project 1, Part 2

Write the classes for the portion of the Adventure Game to which you were assigned. Complete the following objectives:

- Write getters and setters for all instance variables you have included

- Write a constructor that sets all the instance variables that need to be set for your given class. Keep in mind the difference between set instance variables (set from outside the class) and computed instance variables (ones that will be calculated within your class)

- Write six methods that calculate the stat modifiers based on the instance variables. They should return integers that are positive or negative based on the stat modification. The stat modification must not be higher or lower than 2 or -2 for each stat.

- getStrMod()

- getDexMod()

- getConMod()

- getIntMod()

- getWisMod()

- getChaMod()

You do not need to modify every type - some of them can just simply return zero. But you must have all of them.
